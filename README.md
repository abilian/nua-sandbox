# About

Alternative implementation of `Nua` to explore the design space.

DON'T USE. Useful concepts will be merged into the main `Nua` project.

## Key ideas

- Purely declarative build system. (Actually: as declarative as possible.)
- Build profiles for ~10 major web technologies.

## What's missing

No runtime/orchestrator yet.

## TODO

see [TODO.md](./TODO.md)
